    <font size="4" face="Cambria">
        <p class="text-sm-start" align="justify">
            6G technology will come to replace 5G as it has higher speed and even lower latency. But before this we will first have 
            to go through the intermediate technologies to 5G and 6G where we can see 5G + or advanced 5G, according to comments from the Huawei company.
            The 6G network arrives in order to further reduce connection latency and significantly increase transmission speed, which means that it can be 
            used in areas such as industry, economy or medicine.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm-start" align="justify">
            It is estimated that with the speeds that 6G technology will allow, communications can be carried out through holograms, artificial intelligence 
            will have much more impact and development than at present since it will be able to connect and respond much faster to the network. and also the 
            energy efficiency in components. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm-start" align="justify">
            Although they are still estimates, it cannot be denied that 6G technology is very interesting and will undoubtedly revolutionize the way devices 
            connect to the network through radio frequencies.
        </p>

        <font size="9" color ="BLUE" face="Cambria">What is Wi-Fi 6?</font>
        <p class="text-sm-start" align="justify">
            The Wi-Fi 6 standard builds on the benefits of the older Wi-Fi standards while improving efficiency, flexibility, and scalability. With these enhancements, 
            existing and new networks will have greater speed and capacity for next-generation applications. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm-start" align="justify">
            Wi-Fi 6 allows us to connect many more devices to the same network point, such as A.P. This is due to the vision that in the future practically the majority 
            of the things that we currently use will be connected to the Internet. On the other hand, it is not only possible to support a massive amount of devices 
            connected simultaneously to an A.P. but also to optimize in the best way the way in which our bandwidth is distributed since today there are applications that 
            consume a lot such as 4K or 3D video services.
